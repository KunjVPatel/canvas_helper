2. Click the Canvas Helper extension icon (dark interface opens)
3. Click **"ðŸ“¥ Download All Course Files"**
4. Files automatically download to: 
   - **Linux**: `~/Downloads/canvas_downloads/Course_Name/`
   - **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%/Downloads/canvas_downloads/Course_Name/`
   - **Mac**: `~/Downloads/canvas_downloads/Course_Name/`

### ðŸ“„ Export Complete Course Text

1. Navigate to any Canvas course main page
2. Click the Canvas Helper extension icon
3. Click **"ðŸ“‹ Export Complete Course Text"**
4. Creates comprehensive text file with everything:
   - Course information and syllabus
   - All assignments with full descriptions
   - Discussion topics with all replies
   - Complete module structure and content
   - Course pages and announcements
   - Quiz descriptions and instructions
   - Student roster and enrollment info
   - Calendar events and due dates
   - File inventory with metadata

**File saved to**: `canvas_downloads/Course_Name/Course_Name_Complete_Export_TIMESTAMP.txt`

## Supported Canvas Domains

The extension works with:
- `*.instructure.com` (Canvas cloud instances)
- `canvas.*` (Custom Canvas domains)
- `localhost` (For development/testing)

## Technical Details

### File Structure

```
canvas_helper/
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json          # Extension configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ background.js      # Service worker for downloads
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content.js         # Canvas capture functionality
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scraper.js         # File scraping logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ popup.js           # Popup interface logic
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ popup.html         # Extension popup UI
â””â”€â”€ readme.md             # This file
```

### How It Works

1. **Canvas API Integration**:
   - Makes systematic API calls to extract ALL course data
   - Processes assignments, discussions, modules, files, pages, quizzes
   - Handles pagination to get complete datasets
   - Includes user data, calendar events, and enrollments

2. **Multi-Layer File Discovery**:
   - **Canvas Files API**: Official course files
   - **Assignment attachments**: PDFs and documents in assignments
   - **Module resources**: Files embedded in modules
   - **Discussion content**: Files and images in discussions
   - **DOM scraping**: Catches any missed embedded content

3. **Smart Organization**:
   - **File structure**: `canvas_downloads/Course_Name/assignments/`, `/modules/`, `/discussions/`, `/files/`
   - **Text exports**: `canvas_downloads/Course_Name/Course_Name_Complete_Export.txt`
   - **Cross-platform paths**: Adapts to Windows/Linux/Mac
   - **Duplicate handling**: Prevents duplicate downloads

### Permissions Required

- `downloads`: To save files to the user's computer
- `activeTab`: To access the current tab content
- `scripting`: To inject content scripts
- `storage`: To store extension settings
- Host permissions for Canvas domains

## Troubleshooting

### No Files Found
- Make sure you're on a Canvas course page with files
- Check that you have access to the course content
- Some files may require authentication

### Download Failures
- Files may be protected by Canvas permissions
- Network issues or rate limiting may occur
- Check browser's download settings and permissions

### Canvas Capture Issues
- Ensure the page has HTML5 canvas elements
- Some canvases may be protected by CORS policies
- Try refreshing the page and capturing again

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Google Chrome browser
- Basic understanding of Chrome Extension development

### Testing
1. Load the extension in developer mode
2. Navigate to a Canvas course page
3. Test file downloading functionality
4. Check browser console for any errors

### Debugging
- Check the extension's service worker logs in `chrome://extensions/`
- Use browser developer tools to inspect content script behavior
- Monitor network requests in the Network tab
